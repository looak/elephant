# v0.6.5 Release Notes

Major change in this release is the rewrite of my transposition table. It feels like it works a lot better now but that might be subjective. According to the friendly folks on the engine programmer discord my previous table was storing s.k. "hard fails" whilst this new one I wrote to store "soft fails", the latter being more benificial since it gives us better information.

Additionally, I implemented bench amongst other things to supprt running testing the engine with openbench.
