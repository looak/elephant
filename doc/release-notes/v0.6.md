## v0.6.0 Elephant Chess Engine Release Notes
This release focuses on improving search performance and accuracy by introducing new search algorithms and fundamentally changing the way moves are calculated. These changes, along with code cleanup and refactoring, significantly enhance the engine's efficiency and maintainability.

### Improvements:
#### Move Calculation:
Fundamentally refactored move calculation methods for significant performance improvements. This includes changes like heavy use of compile time features such as constexpr and templates. Fixed arrays in the move generator.

Converted to using Square internally instead of Notion to reduce constructor costs.
#### Search Algorithm:
Introduced Quiescence Negamax with Alpha Beta cut off search algorithms, significantly enhancing search functionality.
#### Time Management:
Added a clock class to report time during searches, allowing for time management and early cut off.
#### Code Cleanup: 
Performed code cleanup on multiple files, enhancing readability and maintainability.

### Fixes:
- Fixed tests related to search functionality.
- Corrected a copy-paste mistake when converting to Square use.
- Fixed move parsing and capture detection in UCI::Position.

### Additional Changes:
Cleaned up GCC compiler warnings and removed unnecessary code.
