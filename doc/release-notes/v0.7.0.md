## v0.7.0
Found a significant bug in the transposition table which was causing hazard on my tt-cuts, leading to highly suboptimal moves, solving this was actually, probably, the biggest improvement to the engine.
Moved a lot of the move calculation to be statically initialized which sped up the move generation by about 20%.
